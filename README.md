# Armstrong-number
Python Program to Check Armstrong Number
In this example, you will learn to check whether an n-digit integer is an Armstrong number or not.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

                      * Python if...else Statement
                      * Python while Loop
                      
A positive integer is called an Armstrong number of order n if

abcd... = an + bn + cn + dn + ...
In case of an Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. For example:

153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3  // 153 is an Armstrong number.
